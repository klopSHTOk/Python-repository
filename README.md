# WELCOME TO MY FIRST REPOSITORY

## 1. About files:
- This project was done on a 4K monitor, so if you want to achieve good performance on your system
__you should change some parameters according to your screen resolution__.
- Also, if you want, you can use this code in your projects, but __you need to mark who you took it from__
(like this: '# ---based on 'klopSHTOk' code---')!
----

## 2. First directory - '*Scrambler*':
This program can help you with ***encrypting any files*** on your computer.
Don't forget that __you must save your generated key__ if you want to decrypt files in the future!
    This project *bases on this video* -- 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFbqJoGFB5k', but I've changed it for me.
    
__All you need, you'll find in file 'scrambler.py'__
----

## 3. Second directory - '*Server*':
This program allow you to **create your own simple HTML-pages** on your server.
When you use my code, you will need __to change the directories for your__ files, otherwise the program won't work correctly!
    *First*, run the file '*start_server.py*' and *only then run the file* '*main.py*'

__You'll find all needed information in file 'main.py'__
----

## 4. The last one - '*Translator*':
It's a simple translating program which __can translate words from Russian to English and vice versa__.
You should run this program with specifying of concrete directory if you want to see two pictures as icons,
which are located in your specific directory.

__All needed information you'll find in file 'main.py'__
